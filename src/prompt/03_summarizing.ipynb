       "Apple's new VR headset, called Vision Pro, is set to revolutionize the VR/AR/XR industry. Unlike existing VR hardware, Vision Pro is designed to overcome the limitations of current displays and provide a high-quality, immersive experience. The headset features ultra-dense 4K+ displays for each eye, custom silicon for sensor processing, and a range of sensors and cameras for enhanced functionality. While the $3,500 price tag may seem steep, Apple's investment in creating a top-of-the-line device sets the stage for future advancements in augmented reality wearable technology.\n",
       "\n",
       "The author argues that existing VR hardware, such as Oculus and Vive, is underpowered and lacks support from a large ecosystem. In contrast, Apple has spared no expense in creating a device that offers a range of features and capabilities. While not all of the sensors and widgets may be necessary for a great experience, developers will have the opportunity to explore the possibilities and create innovative applications. As manufacturing processes improve and capacity increases, Apple will be able to offer simplified models at lower costs, further expanding the market for VR/AR technology.\n",
       "\n",
       "The author believes that VR/AR technology is the next paradigm shift in computing, similar to the introduction of cell phones and personal computers. By interposing a device between the eyes and the world, VR/AR technology offers an ultimate display experience. While the technology is still in its early stages, the author predicts that as it becomes more affordable, lightweight, and energy-efficient, it will become more accessible to a wider audience. This will unlock new possibilities for creativity, collaboration, and expression.\n",
       "\n",
       "In conclusion, Apple's Vision Pro VR headset represents a significant advancement in the VR/AR/XR industry. With its high-quality displays, advanced sensors, and extensive ecosystem support, it has the potential to redefine the possibilities of augmented reality. While the price may be a barrier for some, the author believes that Apple's investment in creating a top-of-the-line device will pave the way for future advancements and a more affordable market. The author is eager to see how this new paradigm of computing will unfold and what can be achieved with a limitless monitor."

       "<h2>History of Communications and Internet</h2>\n",
       "<p>The first communications network available to regular people was the telephone. The telephone network was essentially a monopoly operated by AT&T until 1983. Customers rented phones from a subsidiary of AT&T called Western Electric. In 1968, the FCC allowed consumers to connect their own equipment to the phone network, which opened the door for innovation and the use of the phone network for data transmission. At the same time, the first primitive computer networks were being constructed, leading to the development of the Internet as an open system. The Web, built on similar principles as the Internet, became the dominant paradigm for application delivery.</p>\n",
       "<h2>Impact of Mobile Applications in Closed Platforms</h2>\n",
       "<p>The opening of the iOS app store in 2008 standardized the process of downloading, installing, and updating mobile applications, leading to the rapid adoption of mobile apps as the dominant mode of mobile usage. However, mobile apps in closed platforms are less open compared to the Web. The vendor controls both the client and the server, limiting the user's control over their own experience and preventing modifications to the behavior of the app.</p>\n",
       "<h2>Opinions on WEI Proposal</h2>\n",
       "<p>The Web Environment Integrity (WEI) proposal for attestation in remote Web browsing is criticized for imposing a closed system model on the open system of the Web. The proposal aims to attest to the legitimacy of the underlying hardware and software stack, but it restricts the user's control over their own experience and limits the ability to run alternative browsers or modify the behavior of the browser. The proposal's use cases, such as preventing ad blocking or game cheating, require attestation to cover the software itself, which goes against the principles of an open system. WEI represents an attempt to impose control and restrict user freedom in the Web environment.</p>\n",

       "\n",
       "<p>In this chapter, the author discusses the principles of API design and the importance of collaboration, outcome-based focus, selecting the appropriate design elements, and documentation. The author emphasizes the need for organizations to recognize that Web APIs are more than just technology and require a balance of business capabilities, product thinking, and a focus on developer experience.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>The chapter also explores the elements of Web API design, including business capabilities, product thinking, and developer experience. Business capabilities describe the enablers an organization brings to the market, while product thinking focuses on designing APIs that can handle new automation opportunities with little customization effort. Developer experience is crucial for the success of an API, as it enables developers to quickly and confidently consume the API and deliver value to their customers.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>The author further explains that API design is a communication process that extends outward, involving communication across network boundaries, with consuming developers, and to the marketplace. The chapter also highlights the importance of modularization, encapsulation, loose coupling, and high cohesion in API design, as well as the concept of resource-based API design.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>The chapter concludes by introducing the five principles of Web API design: collaborative design, outcome-based focus, selecting appropriate design elements, prioritizing API documentation, and planning for the longevity of APIs.</p><h1>Chapter 2: Collaborative API Design</h1>\n",
       "<p>An API design that looks good to the designer may not be the best design to solve the problems at hand. The initial assumptions about an API design may be incorrect as the API encounters the real world of customer, partner, and workforce needs. API contract design is a separate and critical step of software delivery. Following an API design process encourages communication internally within the organization and externally between the organization and the developers ultimately tasked with integrating the API. It helps to identify incorrect assumptions and validate the assumptions that are correct. Finally, it encourages collaboration between API designers and the developers that will integrate the API.</p>\n",
       "<p>This chapter presents a design process that is flexible to meet the needs of a single API product or mid- to large-scale enterprise API platform. Organizations from as small as 10 employees to those with a staff of more than 10,000 developers have used this collaborative design process. Ultimately, it delivers business value with a customer-centric focus by applying outside-in design using the five principles outlined in Chapter 1, “The Principles of API Design.”</p>\n",
       "<p>An API design process encourages efficiency throughout the delivery process. By focusing on the API contract first, the design represents the needs of users and developers as a primary concern. Also, implementation details are less likely to leak into the API design, resulting in a fragile API design that must introduce breaking changes as implementation details change over time.</p>\n",
       "<p>A backend API is the primary blocker for any frontend delivery schedule. If frontend developers are forced to wait until the backend developers have completed the API implementation, the end-to-end delivery process will take too long. Any errors in design won’t be identified until the frontend developers start to integrate the API. Customer feedback isn’t available until all of the integration work has been completed.</p>\n",
       "<p>An API design process encourages an iterative, team-oriented design effort that allows for greater overall efficiency. The frontend and backend API teams work together to arrive at a design, then parallelize their specific tasks. Customer feedback may be incorporated earlier as well, avoiding last-minute rework efforts. As depicted in Figure 2.2, the process is repeated for each release, ensuring the design process becomes more rapid while incorporating feedback iteratively. Remember that the sooner that API design mistakes are caught, the cheaper they are to fix.</p>\n",
       "<p>Failing to adopt an API design process or adopting a process that is less than effective can lead to the antipatterns that result in negative impacts for the team and the entire organization. Review the common API design antipatterns detailed here and see if any of them resonate.</p>\n",
       "<p>An API design process is a predictable method of moving from business requirements to an API design. The goal of API design is to make it easier to discover, integrate, and deploy solutions in a way that is scalable for the organization and external parties.</p>\n",
       "<p>An API design-first approach is important, as APIs last forever. Once an API has at least one integration in production, it is nearly impossible to migrate consumers to the next version of an API. Taking an API design-first approach starts by identifying the capabilities to deliver, then moves toward an API design to meet the desired outcomes—all before writing a line of production code.</p>\n",
       "<p>The ADDR process is built loosely on concepts and practices found in DDD. However, organizations do not need to be practicing DDD, or even familiar with it, to be effective at applying the process. Those familiar with DDD may recognize some of the concepts and techniques used. However, it is important to recognize that the ADDR process may deviate from DDD practices when necessary to ensure that it remains approachable and repeatable in a variety of situations.</p>\n",
       "<p>Most software development involves several people across a variety of roles. Business leaders and product owners analyze market needs. Software architects and technical leads map out the important design decisions for the solution. Developers design and write the code that makes it all work. Designers and user experience (UX) experts pull everything together as a user interface, with an eye toward usability.</p>\n",
       "<p>The ADDR process may be integrated with any existing process. However, be prepared that some steps may seem uncertain or awkward at first. Over time, the processes will become more familiar, and the labor will be rewarded. Give the organization time to become familiar with the process. It may also be useful to spend time listing previous challenges and how the process seeks to address them.</p><h1>Chapter 3: Identify Digital Capabilities</h1>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>In this chapter, the concept of digital capabilities and their relationship to APIs is introduced. Digital capabilities are assets that turn desired outcomes into reality through automation. They allow organizations to interact with their workforce, partners, and customers digitally. APIs are the most common manifestation of digital capabilities, as they power web and mobile apps, partner integrations, and workforce solutions.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>The chapter emphasizes the importance of stakeholder alignment in API design. API design is a communication process that should incorporate the needs of customers and deliver a great user and developer experience. It is necessary to create alignment between stakeholders and the development teams responsible for implementing the API to avoid negative consequences.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>The chapter also introduces the concept of job stories, which capture the jobs to be done for a product or service. Job stories focus on the desired outcome or accomplishment and help inform the design of digital capabilities. The chapter provides techniques for capturing job stories and addresses common challenges in writing them.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>The chapter concludes with an example of a fictitious API design project for a bookstore. The project explores the challenges involved in designing APIs to support different audiences and operations.</p><h1>Chapter 4: Capture Activities and Steps</h1>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>The chapter begins with a quote from Alberto Brandolini, highlighting the challenges faced by software developers in unfamiliar domains. It emphasizes the need for developers to quickly understand new domains and translate them into working software.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>The chapter introduces the ADDR process, which helps bridge the gap between developers and domain experts. It focuses on capturing domain details and expected behavior using an activity-based structure. The chapter also introduces the EventStorming framework as a collaborative way to explore the domain and gain a deeper understanding.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>The chapter explains how to extend job stories into activities and steps, detailing the process of identifying activities and decomposing them into individual steps. It provides examples of activities and activity steps for a job story related to an online bookstore.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>The chapter also discusses the benefits of EventStorming, including shared understanding, establishment of a common vocabulary, and identification of unknowns. It provides recommendations for facilitating an EventStorming session and customizing the process to fit the needs of the organization.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>Overall, the chapter emphasizes the importance of capturing activities and steps to inform the design of candidate APIs and deliver the necessary digital capabilities.</p><h1>Chapter 5: Identifying API Boundaries</h1>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>Every API provides a mental model for developers to integrate with it and produce desired outcomes. Establishing the scope and responsibilities of an API helps guide the design and contributes to a positive developer experience. Mistakes in defining API boundaries can lead to a poor developer experience.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>There are several API boundary antipatterns to avoid:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>The Mega All-in-One API Antipattern: Creating a single, large API product makes it difficult for developers to find what they need quickly. Many small API products may result in fragmentation and frustration.</li>\n",
       "<li>The Overloaded API Antipattern: Trying to design a single API that does everything for multiple products or a platform leads to an API that does nothing well.</li>\n",
       "<li>The Helper API Antipattern: APIs that have a mixture of uses but aren't cohesive as a unit confuse developers and make it difficult to use effectively.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>API boundaries should be identified using techniques like EventStorming and by reviewing activities and activity steps. Clear boundaries help accelerate the API design and development process by scoping APIs to specific responsibilities. The terminology used for API operations and resources should reflect the bounded context's ubiquitous language.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>APIs should be named based on their scope, outcome, or target audience. The activity steps should be separated into the corresponding API based on the boundary it represents.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>With the boundaries clearly defined, API modeling can begin in the next chapter.</p><h1>Chapter 6: API Modeling</h1>\n",
       "<p>API modeling is a technique for exploring the necessary elements of an API prior to the design and delivery process. It helps to bring together insights and artifacts from previous steps into an API profile that describes the scope and intent of the APIs needed to deliver desired outcomes. API modeling uses job stories, activities, and activity steps to produce a cohesive view of each API, called an API profile. The API profile captures characteristics about the API, including its name, scope, operations, and emitted events. API modeling is done before designing and developing begins, while the cost of change is significantly lower.</p>\n",
       "<p>The API profile structure includes the name and description of the API, the scope of the API, API operations with input and output message details, participants allowed to perform each operation, events generated by each API operation, and optional architectural requirements. API profiles can be captured in a spreadsheet or document, and collaborative tools can be used to capture and refine API profiles.</p>\n",
       "<p>The API modeling process involves five steps: capturing the API profile summary, identifying the resources, defining the resource taxonomy, adding operation events, and expanding operation details. The API model can be validated using sequence diagrams to ensure all requirements have been met, and feedback can be gathered from stakeholders before moving into the design phase.</p>\n",
       "<p>API priority and reuse can be evaluated by assessing the business and competitive value of each API, sizing the effort to build each API, and determining if there are existing APIs that can be leveraged or extended. By spending time modeling APIs, teams can clearly articulate the needs of each API, identify the effort involved in building them, and consider reusing existing APIs to save time and effort.</p><h1>Chapter 7: REST-Based API Design</h1>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>In this chapter, the author discusses the design process for REST-based APIs. The REST interface is designed for efficient large-grain hypermedia data transfer, optimizing for the common case of the Web. The chapter presents an overview of REST and provides a step-by-step process for migrating an API profile into a REST-based API design. It explores various decisions and common design patterns, resulting in a high-level API design that applies REST-based principles.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>The chapter also covers the selection of API design elements that match the need, the definition of a REST-based API, and the architectural properties outlined in Roy Thomas Fielding's paper on REST. It explains the REST architectural constraints, including client/server, stateless, layered system, cacheable, code on demand, and uniform interface. The chapter also introduces the Richardson Maturity Model for measuring REST and discusses when to choose REST as the API style.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>The chapter concludes with a discussion on common REST design patterns, including CRUD-based APIs, extended resource lifecycle support, singleton resources, background (queued) jobs, and long-running transaction support in REST.</p><h1>Chapter 8: RPC and Query-Based API Design</h1>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>Choosing the right architectural style for a network-based application requires an understanding of the problem domain and the communication needs of the application. This chapter explores RPC- and query-based API styles as alternatives or supplements to REST-based APIs.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<h2>RPC-Based API</h2>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>RPC-based APIs execute a unit of code over the network as if it were being executed locally. The client is given a list of available procedures to invoke on the server. RPC-based APIs require a specification that supports the marshaling of the procedure invocation for the target programming language. Examples of RPC-based APIs include CORBA, XML-RPC, SOAP RPC, JSON-RPC, and gRPC.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<h2>gRPC Protocol</h2>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>gRPC, created by Google, is an RPC-based API style that uses HTTP/2 for transport and Protocol Buffers for serialization. It leverages bidirectional streaming and supports multiple programming languages. gRPC requires the use of proto files to define services, methods, and messages exchanged.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<h2>Factors to Consider</h2>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>When considering RPC-based APIs, it is important to note that they trade performance for tighter coupling. The integration between client and server is tightly coupled, and the serialization format is fixed. Some RPC protocols, like gRPC, require custom middleware for browser support and authorization. Additionally, gRPC depends on HTTP/2 and requires customization of HTTP request headers.</p>\n",

       "\n",
       "<p>When delivering an API, it is important to prioritize the needs of API consumers. This includes creating mock APIs to gather feedback on the API design and offering helper libraries and command-line interfaces to simplify integration for developers of all skill levels.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>Mock API implementations are useful for verifying that the API design meets the needs of developers. They allow developers to integrate with the API before the actual implementation has begun, helping to identify missing functionality and data elements.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>There are three types of API mock implementations: static mocking, prototyping, and README-based mocking. Static mocking involves creating static versions of API requests and responses using JSON or XML files. Prototyping allows for more comprehensive testing of API operations, including creating and modifying resource state. README-based mocking uses README files to demonstrate API usage and desired outcomes.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>Helper libraries and SDKs (Software Development Kits) provide programming language-specific wrappers for the API, simplifying integration for developers. Provider-supported, community-contributed, and consumer-generated options are available for offering helper libraries. Versioning and documentation are important considerations for helper libraries, and thorough testing is necessary to ensure they are in sync with the latest API enhancements.</p>\n",

Acceptance testing ensures that the API supports the captured job stories and produces the desired outcomes. Automated security testing aims to protect the API against attacks and prevent sensitive data leakage. Operational monitoring ensures that the API is available and performing as expected, staying within expected SLAs. API contract testing verifies that each API operation meets the expected behavior and honors the API’s defined contract for the consumer.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>API testing should not be replaced by user interface (UI) testing, as UI tests only cover the API as far as the UI exercises it. API testing is necessary to handle a multitude of good and bad values that may be submitted outside of a specific UI. Test-driven development (TDD) can be extended through the strategic selection of API testing tools, and API tests should become part of the continuous integration and delivery pipeline.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>Creating test data sets for APIs can be challenging, and there are two common approaches: snapshot of existing data sets and cleanroom data set creation. Snapshotting a production system and cleansing the data set is a direct path, while cleanroom data set creation involves creating cohesive data sets from scratch. API testing should be considered essential and not overlooked, as it helps ensure API correctness, reliability, and security.</p><h1>Chapter 13: Document the API Design</h1>\n",
