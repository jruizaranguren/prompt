       "Apple's new VR headset, called Vision Pro, is set to revolutionize the VR/AR/XR industry. Unlike existing VR hardware, Vision Pro is designed to overcome the limitations of current displays and provide a high-quality, immersive experience. The headset features ultra-dense 4K+ displays for each eye, custom silicon for sensor processing, and a range of sensors and cameras for enhanced functionality. While the $3,500 price tag may seem steep, Apple's investment in creating a top-of-the-line device sets the stage for future advancements in augmented reality wearable technology.\n",
       "\n",
       "The author argues that existing VR hardware, such as Oculus and Vive, is underpowered and lacks support from a large ecosystem. In contrast, Apple has spared no expense in creating a device that offers a range of features and capabilities. While not all of the sensors and widgets may be necessary for a great experience, developers will have the opportunity to explore the possibilities and create innovative applications. As manufacturing processes improve and capacity increases, Apple will be able to offer simplified models at lower costs, further expanding the market for VR/AR technology.\n",
       "\n",
       "The author believes that VR/AR technology is the next paradigm shift in computing, similar to the introduction of cell phones and personal computers. By interposing a device between the eyes and the world, VR/AR technology offers an ultimate display experience. While the technology is still in its early stages, the author predicts that as it becomes more affordable, lightweight, and energy-efficient, it will become more accessible to a wider audience. This will unlock new possibilities for creativity, collaboration, and expression.\n",
       "\n",
       "In conclusion, Apple's Vision Pro VR headset represents a significant advancement in the VR/AR/XR industry. With its high-quality displays, advanced sensors, and extensive ecosystem support, it has the potential to redefine the possibilities of augmented reality. While the price may be a barrier for some, the author believes that Apple's investment in creating a top-of-the-line device will pave the way for future advancements and a more affordable market. The author is eager to see how this new paradigm of computing will unfold and what can be achieved with a limitless monitor."

       "<p>Posted by ekr on 18 Aug 2023</p>\n",
       "<h2>History of Communications and Internet</h2>\n",
       "<p>The first communications network available to regular people was the telephone. The telephone network was essentially a monopoly operated by AT&T until 1983. Customers rented phones from a subsidiary of AT&T called Western Electric. In 1968, the FCC allowed consumers to connect their own equipment to the phone network, which opened the door for innovation and the use of the phone network for data transmission. At the same time, the first primitive computer networks were being constructed, leading to the development of the Internet as an open system. The Web, built on similar principles as the Internet, became the dominant paradigm for application delivery.</p>\n",
       "<h2>Impact of Mobile Applications in Closed Platforms</h2>\n",
       "<p>The opening of the iOS app store in 2008 standardized the process of downloading, installing, and updating mobile applications, leading to the rapid adoption of mobile apps as the dominant mode of mobile usage. However, mobile apps in closed platforms are less open compared to the Web. The vendor controls both the client and the server, limiting the user's control over their own experience and preventing modifications to the behavior of the app.</p>\n",
       "<h2>Opinions on WEI Proposal</h2>\n",
       "<p>The Web Environment Integrity (WEI) proposal for attestation in remote Web browsing is criticized for imposing a closed system model on the open system of the Web. The proposal aims to attest to the legitimacy of the underlying hardware and software stack, but it restricts the user's control over their own experience and limits the ability to run alternative browsers or modify the behavior of the browser. The proposal's use cases, such as preventing ad blocking or game cheating, require attestation to cover the software itself, which goes against the principles of an open system. WEI represents an attempt to impose control and restrict user freedom in the Web environment.</p>\n",
